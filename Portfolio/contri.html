                    <p class="box-description">In A3, I designed Nature Track, an app to connect people with Brisbane wildlife and encourage conservation. My goal was to create an engaging and user-friendly app that helps people explore and learn about nature. With features like interactive maps, species information, and real-time conservation updates, I aimed to make environmental education accessible and interesting. Through Nature Track, I hope to inspire others to appreciate and protect the local flora and fauna around them, while actively getting involved in preservation efforts.</p>

                    <p class="box-description">The design proposal for WildSnap, an interactive website to connect users with Queensland's wildlife. I used Figma to design four key pages: the Encyclopedia page, Animal Information page, Quiz page, and Gallery page. This project taught me the importance of each step in the design process, from sketching to building detailed layouts in Figma and presenting them in Miro. WildSnap is designed to be educational, accessible, and enjoyable, helping users connect with nature and learn about wildlife conservation.</p>

                    <p class="box-description">For the MVP assessment, I contributed to the Animal Information page by writing the HTML structure and basic CSS layout from scratch. I focused on establishing a clear, user-friendly layout for the page while leaving the more advanced functionality for others to develop. This experience helped me build a stronger foundation in HTML and CSS, reinforcing the importance of clean, accessible design as a basis for more complex features. Working on MVP allowed me to improve my foundational skills and better understand the design process.</p>

                    <p class="box-description">Our team also wanted to incorporate pixel art to make our website unique and engaging. I added a playful pixelated background with small animal animations, especially in the gallery section, to draw user interest. This involved several creative experiments, and with each iteration, I refined my animation techniques to make the animals livelier and more interactive.</p>
